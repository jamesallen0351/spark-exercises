# Spark Exercises Repo

This repo is for covering the basics of working with spark dataframes, and show how spark dataframes are different from pandas dataframes.

While spark dataframes might superficially look like pandas dataframes, and even share some of the same methods and syntax, it is important to keep in mind they are 2 seperate types of objects, and, while spark and pandas code might look superficially similar, it tends to be semantically very different.
